# Session of Machine Learning Division of CyberLabs
Conducted on: 19/12/2025

## Agenda
RNN, LSTMs, GRUs, Sequence modeling

## Summary
1. Introduced sequence modeling, looked at how traditional approaches fail to properly capture the positional relations.
2. Discussed how 1-D convolutions with dilated convolutions can also be used in sequence modeling. 
3. Looked at how RNNs are better than neural networks using the unfolding mechanism to capture these relationships.
4. Examined how LSTMs are much better than RNNs due to the different gates, allowing it to accurately retain information without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem.
5. Constant Error Carousel and Bidirectional LSTMs. 


## Agenda for the next session
* Tokenization
* Word Embeddings & Word2Vec
