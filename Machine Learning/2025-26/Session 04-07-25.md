# Session of Machine Learning Division of CyberLabs
Conducted on: 04/07/2025

## Agenda
VGGNet and GoogLeNet

## Summary
1. The effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy. 

2. Analyze the key design choices (small filters, increasing depth).

3. ⁠Training process of VGG (Preprocessing techniques, Choice of Hyperparameters, choice of training Scale S).

4. Testing process of VGG (Choice of test scale).

5. Different validation methods- Single Scale, Multi Scale, Dense evaluation and Multi-Crop.

6. Comparison with the state of art.

7. VGG performance on Localisation Test and Mean Average Precision(mAP).

8. Need of GoogLeNet, discussion on Hebbian Principle.

9. ⁠Need of 1x1 conv and why max pooling befor 1x1 conv.
    
10. Sparse and Deep connections.

11. Architecture detail of Inception Model.

12. Results of GoogLeNet.
